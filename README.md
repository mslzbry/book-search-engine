## Description

This web app is a search engine for books; it uses the Google Books API search engine, GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, and the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. GraphQL queries and mutations are used to fetch and modify data, and an Apollo Provider is created so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
